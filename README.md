## Configuration

### Access Settings
By default, the web app is set to:
- Execute as: User accessing the web app
- Access: Only myself

To share with others, modify the `webapp.access` setting in `appsscript.json`:
- `"MYSELF"` - Only you can access
- `"DOMAIN"` - Anyone in your Google Workspace domain
- `"ANYONE"` - Anyone with the link
- `"ANYONE_ANONYMOUS"` - Anyone, even anonymous

### Data Storage
The app automatically creates a Google Sheet called "Claude Artifacts Database" in your Google Drive to store all artifacts.

## File Structure

- `Code.js` - Main server-side Google Apps Script code
- `home.html` - Homepage with overview and recent artifacts
- `add.html` - Form to add new artifacts
- `search.html` - Search and browse all artifacts
- `artifact.html` - Individual artifact detail view
- `stylesheet.html` - Shared CSS styles
- `appsscript.json` - Project manifest file

## Usage

1. **Adding Artifacts**
   - Click "Add Artifact" in the navigation
   - Fill in the title, description, type, and content
   - Add relevant tags for better discoverability
   - Submit to save to the database

2. **Searching Artifacts**
   - Use the search bar to find artifacts by title, description, or tags
   - Filter by artifact type
   - Click popular tags for quick filtering
   - Sort results by date, title, type, or author

3. **Viewing Artifacts**
   - Click on any artifact card to view full details
   - Copy code snippets with one click
   - See creation date and author information

## Development

To modify the app:

1. Make changes to the files locally
2. Push changes to Google Apps Script:
   ```bash
   clasp push
   ```
3. Create a new deployment:
   ```bash
   clasp deploy -d "Description of changes"
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- **"User has not enabled the Apps Script API" error**: Enable the API at https://script.google.com/home/usersettings
- **Permission errors**: Check the `webapp.access` setting in `appsscript.json`
- **Sheet not found**: The app will automatically create a new sheet on first run
